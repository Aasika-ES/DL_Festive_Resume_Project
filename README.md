Project Title: Image Caption Generator using CNN-RNN

Description: This project builds an image caption generator leveraging CNN-RNN architecture. The model combines Xception for feature extraction and LSTM for language generation, generating descriptive captions for images in the Flickr8k dataset. The project explores deep learning's potential in image-to-text translation, demonstrating the synergy between visual and language models.
